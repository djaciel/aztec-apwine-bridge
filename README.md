# Aztek ApWine Bridge

In this project I create a bridge to ApWine for the Aztek ecosystem.
This code was made using Foundry framework.

Deployed on the Aztek testnet and used in the zk.money app.

All my code is in the following paths:

```
./aztec-connect-bridges/src/bridges/apwine/..
./aztec-connect-bridges/src/test/bridges/apwine/..
./aztec-connect-bridges/src/deployment/apwine/..
./aztec-connect-bridges/src/interfaces/apwine/..
```
